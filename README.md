# pdf-toolz
This is an open-source PDF tool. 

This tool is based on 'Didier Stevens' PDF tools. These PDF tools are available at [Didier Stevens blog](http://blog.didierstevens.com)


**List of Tools**

## 1. PDF iD
The PDFiD tool will anaylyse the PDF or any file your provide it, but the real focus remains over PDF files. It will visualize the tag names that make a PDF file. It will also show any javascript code or file embedded in the PDF, any other file (including executables) and any code embedded to the file. Using this tool you can also disarm javascript of a PDF file.

## 2. PDF Parser
The PDF parser tool will parse each and every object of the PDF file. This tool will give you a good visual view of the objects that made the PDF file. You can use any object  inside the PDF file or the PDF file itself to create a python program.

## 3. Create PDF Embedded
Using this tool you can create a PDF file where you can store any other file inside it. You can also store string or code inside it.

## 4. Create PDF Javascript
Using this tool you can add javascript code or javascript file to create a PDF file using that code as embedded.

**Future**

In future I will add more pdf tools to this tool.
